# Intelligence, brain size, and brain morphometry: resolving conflicting claims


Brain size is associated with intelligence, but the relationship between brain morphometric measures and intelligence is unclear. Studies have produced conflicting results or no significant relations between intelligence and morphometric measures such as cortical thickness and peri-cortical contrast. This discrepancy may be due to a failure to fully account for the relationship between brain size and intelligence. Our study shows that neither cortical thickness nor peri-cortical contrast improves IQ prediction accuracy beyond what is achieved with brain volume alone.

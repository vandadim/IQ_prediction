# IQ prediction

# Intelligence, brain size, and brain morphometry: resolving conflicting claims


Brain size is associated with intelligence, but the relationship between brain morphometric measures and intelligence is unclear. Studies have produced conflicting results or no significant relations between intelligence and morphometric measures such as cortical thickness and peri-cortical contrast. This discrepancy may be due to a failure to fully account for the relationship between brain size and intelligence. Our study shows that neither cortical thickness nor peri-cortical contrast improves IQ prediction accuracy beyond what is achieved with brain volume alone.

## Introduction

## Dataset

This work presents three distinct studies that investigate the prediction of IQ scores across different age groups. Firstly, we assess IQ prediction in children using data from the first visit of the ABCD study. Secondly, we explore IQ prediction in developmental data, specifically in subjects ranging from middle childhood through adolescence, using data from the first visit of the NIH pediatric dataset. Finally, we investigate IQ prediction in adults, utilizing data from the Nathan-Klein Institute - Rockland Sample.
